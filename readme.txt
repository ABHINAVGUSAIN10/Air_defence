# 🛡️ AI R Defence System

This project is a web-based simulation of an air defence system that uses computer vision and deep learning models to identify, track, and simulate engagement with potential aerial threats. The entire user interface is built using the Flask web framework.

## ✨ Features

- **Aircraft Detection & Classification**: Upload aircraft images and use a YOLOv8 model to detect and classify the aircraft type (e.g., A10, B2).
- **Radar Signal Analysis**: Upload corresponding `.npy` I/Q data files to classify the aircraft's radar signal modulation using a custom RadarCNN model.
- **Trajectory Prediction**: An LSTM model pre-calculates a realistic flight path for each detected aircraft.
- **Interactive Web UI**: A clean, multi-page web interface built with Flask allows users to upload files, view analysis results, and mark threats.
- **Live Radar Simulation**: A dynamic canvas-based animation displays a live radar screen with a sweeping effect, a central military base, and all detected aircraft.
- **Threat Engagement**: Aircraft marked as "threats" are automatically engaged with a missile animation once they enter the radar's range.
- **Live Status Panel**: A side panel displays real-time information for each aircraft, including its name, status (Active/Destroyed), and dynamically updating coordinates.

## 📂 Project Structure

The project is organized into distinct directories for data, models, scripts, and the web application itself.

## 🚀 Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project environment on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.8+
* Pip package manager

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    Open your terminal, navigate to where you want to store the project, and run:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd AIR_DEFENCE
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

    * On **Windows**:
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * On **macOS & Linux**:
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

3.  **Install required libraries:**
    With your virtual environment activated, install all dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Add Model Weights:**
    * Place your trained model files (e.g., `best.pt`, `best_radar_cnn.pth`, `trajectory_lstm.pth`) inside the `models/` directory.
    * **Important:** You must verify that the hardcoded file paths inside each script in the `modules/` folder (`yolo_inference.py`, `radar_classifier.py`, etc.) point to the correct location of your model files.

## ▶️ How to Run

1.  **Navigate to the project root** (`AIR_DEFENCE`) and ensure your virtual environment is activated.

2.  **Run the Flask application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

3.  **Open the UI in Your Browser:**
    After running the command, the terminal will show that the server is active. Open your web browser and go to the URL provided, which is usually:
    **`http://127.0.0.1:5000`**

## 📋 How to Use

1.  **Upload Files**: On the main page, upload one or more aircraft images (`.jpg`, `.png`). For each image, upload the corresponding `.npy` file with the **exact same base name** (e.g., `plane1.jpg` and `plane1.npy`).
2.  **Analyze Results**: You will be taken to the "Analysis Results" page. Here you can see the aircraft type and radar modulation for each detected plane.
3.  **Mark Threats**: Use the checkboxes to mark any aircraft you want to designate as a threat.
4.  **Run Simulation**: Click the "Run Simulation" button to launch the live radar display and watch the engagement.
